# File-integrity-checker

 The File Integrity Checker project monitors the integrity of important files by calculating and storing their hash values. The program generates a hash of the file and stores it for future comparisons. When the file is checked again, the program recalculates the hash and compares it with the stored value. If the values differ, it indicates that the file has been modified, potentially due to malicious tampering.

# Why It's Important in Cybersecurity:
In the world of cybersecurity, ensuring the integrity of files is crucial for detecting tampering, unauthorized modifications, or the presence of malware. This tool is essential for validating critical files or system configurations that should not change without authorization. File integrity checking is often part of larger systems used for detecting breaches, protecting sensitive data, and maintaining secure systems.
